# Install Script Commands from this repository
To install Time Tracker commands, follow these steps:
1. Download this repository
2. Move the 3 command script in your Raycast command script directory
3. Open the `time-tracking-stop` script and set your webhook `URL` (e.g Integromat, Zapier,...)

Now test the command script by opening Raycast and type `Start Tracking` 


ðŸ’¡ Hint: If you don't provide a webhook url, the task and time tracked will be added to your clipboard once you stop the tracking.
